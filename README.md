# Loan_Eligibility_Prediction

The following repository is an indepth analysis of the dataset which contains information on whether an applicant is eligible for a loan or not.
For an in depth analysis and understanding of the dataset please check this [pdf file](https://github.com/vijaykumar1799/Loan_Eligibility_Prediction/blob/main/Loan_Eligibility_Data_Analysis_Modeling_Report.pdf).


Moreover, this repository explores the following machine learning algorithms and evaluates how each model performs with respect to each other.
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
- Random Forest Classification.


Overall, results and insights are all discussed in this detailed [pdf file](https://github.com/vijaykumar1799/Loan_Eligibility_Prediction/blob/main/Loan_Eligibility_Data_Analysis_Modeling_Report.pdf).
